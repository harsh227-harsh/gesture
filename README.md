# Gesture-Recognizer

Gesture recognition in JavaScript involves detecting and interpreting human gestures, typically using input devices like a mouse, touchpad, or touchscreen. It allows web applications to respond to various gestures, such as tapping, swiping, pinching, rotating, and more, providing a more intuitive and interactive user experience.

To implement gesture recognition in JavaScript, you can use various libraries and APIs tailored for this purpose, such as Hammer.js, ZingTouch, or the Web Gesture API. These tools often offer functionalities to identify different gestures and their corresponding actions.

For instance, with Hammer.js, you might set up event listeners for specific gestures like tap, swipe, pinch, or rotate. When the user performs these actions on the specified elements, corresponding JavaScript functions can be triggered to execute specific tasks or behaviors within the web application.

SINGLE HAND GESTURE = ✌️ ||  🖐  || ✊️
MULTIPLE HAND GESTURE = 🙅
